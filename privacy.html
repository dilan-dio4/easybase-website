                    The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") protects the online privacy of children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from anyone under the age of 13, unless or except as permitted by law.

                <h6>USE OF NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION</h6>
                <p>
                    “Non-Personally-Identifying Information” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person. “Personally-Identifying Information,” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person. Like most website operators, Company gathers from users of the Website Non-Personally-Identifying Information of the sort that Web browsers, depending on their settings, may make available. That information includes the user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, operating system and browser type, and the locations of the Web pages the user views right before arriving at, while navigating and immediately after leaving the Website. Although such information is not personally identifiable, it may be possible for Company to determine from an IP address a user’s Internet service provider and the geographic location of the visitor’s point of connectivity as well as other statistical usage data. Company analyzes Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website to help Company better understand how the Website is being used. By identifying patterns and trends in usage, Company is able to better design the Website to improve users’ experiences, both in terms of content and ease of use. From time to time, Company may also release the Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from Website users in the aggregate, such as by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the Website.

                    A “Web Cookie” is a string of information which assigns you a unique identification that a website stores on a user’s computer, and that the user’s browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the site. We use cookies on the Website to keep track of services you have used, to record registration information regarding your login name and password, to record your user preferences, to keep you logged into the Website, and to facilitate purchase procedures. Company also uses Web Cookies to track the pages that users visit during each Website session, both to help Company improve users’ experiences and to help Company understand how the Website is being used. As with other Non-Personally-Identifying Information gathered from users of the Website, Company analyzes and discloses in aggregated form information gathered using Web Cookies, so as to help Company, its partners and others better understand how the Website is being used. COMPANY USERS WHO DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON THEIR COMPUTERS SHOULD SET THEIR BROWSERS TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES BEFORE ACCESSING THE WEBSITE, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THE WEBSITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. WEBSITE USERS WHO REFUSE WEB COOKIES ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.

                    We may use third-party vendors, including Google, who use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to provide analytics services, inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past activity on our websites and applications, including Google Analytics for Display Advertising.

This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our service and other websites and better understand your online activity.

                    <hr />

                    We may share aggregated and Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties and our affiliate companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our Website and on websites of third parties. We may combine Non-Personally Identifying Information we collect with additional Non-Personally Identifying Information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any Personally-Identifying Information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.

                    As defined above, Personally-Identifying Information is information that can be directly associated with a specific person. Company may collect a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about Website users. Much of the Personally-Identifying Information collected by Company about users is information provided by users themselves when (1) registering for our service, (2) logging in with social network credentials, (3) participating in polls, contests, surveys or other features of our service, or responding to offers or advertisements, (4) communicating with us, (5) creating a public profile, or (6) signing up to receive newsletters. That information may include each user’s name, address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender, age, date of birth, username, hometown and other demographic information, and other relevant information as determined by Company from time to time. Users of the Website are under no obligation to provide Company with Personally-Identifying Information of any kind, with the caveat that a user’s refusal to do so may prevent the user from using certain Website features.

                    <hr />

                    Certain Personally-Identifying Information collected from users may be disclosed as a matter of course as a result of those users’ use of the Website. We may provide areas on our Website where you can post reviews and other information relating to your activities on the Website. Such postings are governed by our Terms of Use. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. USERS ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM THEIR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.

                    <hr />

                    We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services offered by the Website that we think you may find valuable.

Generally, you may opt out of such emails at the time of registration or through your account settings, though we reserve the right to send you notices about your account, such as service announcements, and administrative messages, even if you opt out of all voluntary email notifications.

                <h6>COLLECTION AND USE OF CUSTOMER DATA HOSTED BY COMPANY</h6>
                <p>
                    This section of the Privacy Policy addresses how Company may collect, process, store, use and disclose the data which you may create, maintain, use or disclose in connection with your account (“Customer Data”). In order to provide the Website Services, Company hosts and processes Customer Data in connection with your account. By creating, maintaining, using or disclosing Customer Data in connection with the Website Service and your account, you acknowledge that you are the owner or that you otherwise have the right, authority or consent to control such Customer Data and to authorize Company and its employees, agents and contractors to take such actions with respect to Customer Data as described in this Privacy Policy
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, Customer Data in your account is not accessible to anyone, unless you choose to make it accessible. Company facilitates and provides tools for you to manage access to and use of your Customer Data, including sharing such information on a website or otherwise making such information available to others. However, you, and only you, control whether and what Customer Data to create, maintain, use or disclose in connection with your account and any corresponding website. You are solely responsible for granting access to others, publishing, sharing, updating or deleting such Customer Data in your account. Company is not responsible for any such access to, activities, use or disclosure involving Customer Data, regardless of how or by whom such occurs.
                    In limited circumstances, Company or its employees, agents and contractors may have access to, use or disclose Customer Data in order to provide the Website Services. The following are some of the more common (but not exhaustive) circumstances under which Company, and its employees, agents and contractors may have access to, use or disclose Customer Data in order to provide the Website Services:
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    b. To conduct security activities related to preventing, detecting, investigating and responding to security incidents, threats or vulnerabilities, implementing security safeguards and controls and other activities related to security;
                    c. To respond to or provide support and related activities which you have requested in connection with your account and the Website Services, or which you have otherwise consented to;
                    d. In response to court orders, legal process, or as otherwise required by applicable law;
                    e. In connection with suspension, termination or expiration of the Terms of Use as set forth in the Terms of Use, or as necessary to resolve any dispute related to the Terms of Use; or
                    f. When we act under exigent circumstances, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to protect the safety of customers or the public.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Company will only make available Customer Data to its employees, agents or contractors who have a need to know or access in order to provide Website Services to or on behalf of Company as described in this Privacy Policy. Company will never use or disclose Customer Data for marketing, advertising or other similar commercial purposes.

                <h6>COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES GENERALLY</h6>
                <p>
                    Company contractually prohibits its contractors, affiliates, vendors and suppliers from disclosing Personally-Identifying Information received from Company, other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy, however, with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that users provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. These third parties include advertisers, providers of games, utilities, widgets and a variety of other third party applications accessible through the Website. Company neither owns nor controls the third-party websites and applications accessible through the Website. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party, or using a third party application, whether by means of a link on the Website, directly through the Website, or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any such third party, users should inform themselves of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website or application, and should take those steps necessary to, in those users’ discretion, protect their privacy.

However, please be advised that even the best security measures cannot fully eliminate all risks. We cannot guarantee that only authorized persons will view your information. We are not responsible for third party circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures.
